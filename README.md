The basic steps we plan to use:
1- greb needed data via an offline script, digest it, and store it in a MongoDB
2- design your experiment user interfaces using the stored data and beautiful viz
3- let participants play (and save relevant data to your experiment)
4- when possible, give them nice feedback
5- go process the data and write some paper ;)
